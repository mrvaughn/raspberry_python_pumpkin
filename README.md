# raspberry_python_pumpkin
Simple Python code used to create a video jukebox in a pumpkin.

A Raspberry Pi, connected to a 7" Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Display, was used to play video inside a pumpkin for a jack-o-lantern contest. See a video of the pumpkin in the "Videos" folder. A sensor (OSEPP IR Detector, part no. OSEPP-IRD-01) was wired to the GPIO port on the Raspberry Pi and was used to detect when someone dropped a coin or bill in a bucket. This triggered first a "thank you video" to play, followed by a video from the "Videos" folder, which contained various short Halloween-related videos. After the video completes, another video is played simulating eyes on a pumpkin. This contest was a United Way fundraiser.
